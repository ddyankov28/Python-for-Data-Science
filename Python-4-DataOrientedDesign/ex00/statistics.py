# NOTES:
# - If you don't know how many arguments that will be passed into a function
#   add a '*' before the parameter name in the function definition.
#   This way the function will receive a tuple of args and cann access
#   the items accordingly
# - You can also send arguments with the key = value syntax. This way
#   the order of the arguments does not matter
